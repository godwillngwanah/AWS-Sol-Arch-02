LAB (EFS)
 
	Create EFS and mount same EFS file on 2 private instances.
	
	
	Create a VPC with NID (CIDR)  192.168.0.0/16  EFSVPC
	
	1.	1 Public Subnet in AZ1a NID  192.168.0.0/26  Bastion Host (Jumpbox)  Public EFS Subnet
	2.	1 Private Subnet in AZ1b NID  192.168.1.0/26 in private network  Private EFS Subnet1
	3.	1 Private subnet in AZ1c NID  192.168.2.0/26 in private network  Private EFS Subnet2
	
	By default VPC will 
		A.	RT1  Public  Public-EFS-RT
		B.	SG 
		C.	Network ACL (Do not need)
		
	Things we will create
		A.	Subnet (Total 3 subnets)
		B.	Private RT  Private-EFS-RT
		C.	IGW  EFS-IGW
		D.	NAT  EFS-NAT-GWY
		
	- Lunch 1 Linux instance in public subnet
	- Lunch 2 Linux instances in the 2 private subnets
	- ssh into bastion host and create keypair
	- Login to Private server 1 through bastion host 
	
	Perform below task to mount EFS 
	
	a. sudo su -
	b. mkdir /mnt/efs
	c. cd /mnt/
	d. copy mount command from aws efs service, paste command then Enter
	e. mount | grep efs 
	f. cd efs
	g. vim file1
	h. Press i, Enter any text and :wq! to save file and exit
	i. Repeat same steps for Private server2
