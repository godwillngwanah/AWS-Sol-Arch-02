LAB - VPC Peering


You work for tngs corperation. tngs has resoources (example EC2 instances) in both us-east-1(Virginia) and us-east2(Ohio)

You have been assigned to establish a 2 way communications between resources in both regions.

Solutions:

Step 1: 
Creating Reourses:

	Create vpc peering for both region vpcs' and communications between vpc resources


		A. us-east-1(Virginia) - VPCA
			- EC2 called LinuxServerA
	

			
			
	1. Create a vpc in us-east-1 with CIDR block 10.10.0.0/16 - VPCA
	2. Create a Subnet in us-east-1 with CIDR block 10.10.0.0/24 - public subnet A
	3. Create IGW (IGWA) and attach to VPCA
	4. Associate public subnet A to the default VPCA Route Table
	5. Created an EC2 Instance in us-east-1 - LinuxServerA
	
	

		B. us-east2(Ohio)  - VPCB - 132.0.0.0/16
			- public subnet B - 132.0.0.0/24
			- EC2 called LinuxServerB
			
			
	* Repeat same process for us-east2
	
	1. Create a vpc in us-east-2 with CIDR block 132.0.0.0/16 - VPCB
	2. Create a Subnet in us-east-2 with CIDR block 132.0.0.0/24 - public subnet B
	3. Create IGW (IGWB) and attach to VPCB
	4. Associate public subnet B to the default VPCB Route Table
	5. Created an EC2 Instance in us-east-2 - LinuxServerB

Step 2:
Creating Peering connection

    1. Create vpc peering in us-east-1 --> VPCA-VPCB_Peering
	2. Navigate to aws region us-east-2 > VPC > Click on peering connection > Accept peering connection 
	3. ADD VPCB CIDR to us-east-1 vpcA route table  as source and peering connection as target
	4. Add new rule in LinuxServerA security group > Allowing all traffic for same VPCB CIDR 
	5. Repeat same steps for us-east-2
	6. ssh into LinuxServerA and ping Private IP of LinuxServerB
		- use command "ping"
	7. ssh into LinuxServerB and ping Private IP of LinuxServerA
		- use command "ping"
