RTO vs RPO

RTO 
The RTO, or recovery time objective, is the maximum length of time 
after an outage that your company is willing to wait for the recovery 
process to finish. 

RPO
On the other hand, the RPO, or recovery point 
objective, is the maximum amount of data loss your company is 
willing to accept as measured in time.
